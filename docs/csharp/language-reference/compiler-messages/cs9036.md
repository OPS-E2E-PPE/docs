# Compiler Error CS9036

Required member 'member name' must be assigned a value, it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.

The `required` modifier specifies that a member must be set during object initialization. When a member is marked as `required`, it must be assigned a complete value directly, not through nested member initializers or collection initializers.

## Example

The following sample generates CS9036:

```csharp
// CS9036.cs (15,17)

class C
{
    public string? Prop { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    public required C C { get; set; }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        var program = new Program()
        {
            // error CS9036: Required member 'Program.C' must be assigned a value, it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.
            C = { Prop = "a" }
        };
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

To fix this error, assign a complete object instance to the required member instead of using nested initialization:

```csharp
class C
{
    public string? Prop { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    public required C C { get; set; }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        var program = new Program()
        {
            // Assign a complete object instance
            C = new C { Prop = "a" }
        };
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can assign an existing object instance:

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    var c = new C { Prop = "a" };
    var program = new Program()
    {
        C = c
    };
}
```
