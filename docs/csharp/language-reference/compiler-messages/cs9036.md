# Compiler Error CS9036

Required member 'member name' must be assigned a value, it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.

This error occurs when you try to initialize a `required` property or field using a collection initializer or nested object initializer syntax. Required members must be assigned a direct value during object initialization.

## Example

The following sample generates CS9036:

```csharp
class C
{
    public string? Prop { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    public required C C { get; set; }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        // CS9036: Required member 'Program.C' must be assigned a value, 
        // it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.
        var program = new Program()
        {
            C = { Prop = "a" }
        };
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

To correct this error, assign a value directly to the required member instead of using collection or nested initializer syntax:

```csharp
class C
{
    public string? Prop { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    public required C C { get; set; }
    
    static void Main()
    {
        // Correct: Direct assignment
        var program = new Program()
        {
            C = new C { Prop = "a" }
        };
    }
}
```
