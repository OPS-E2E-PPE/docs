# Compiler Error CS9036

Required member must be assigned a value, it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.

When using the `required` modifier on a property or field, the member must be directly assigned a value during object initialization. You cannot use nested member initializers or collection initializers to satisfy the required member constraint.

## Example

The following sample generates CS9036:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/cs9036/Program.cs" id="CS9036":::

## To correct this error

To fix this error, directly assign a value to the required member instead of using a nested initializer:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/cs9036/Program.cs" id="CS9036Fix":::
